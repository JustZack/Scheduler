Current DB Structure:
  Schedule DB=>{
      meta=>{
          id,
          name,
          open,
          close
      },
      company=>{
        id,
        employees=>(json){json_data}
      }
  }
  
---------------------------------------------
  
This structure enables a heavy use of the JSON format.
The only tables in the DB (Atleast in its least bloated state) are:
  meta: 
    Which contains basic information for directly accessing a companies data with an index in each row.
  companies:
    Contains very specific data about a company and its employees in each row.
    
  New DB Structure:
    Schedule DB=>{
      meta=>{      
        id,
        name,
        index
      }
      companies=>{
        id,
        meta=>(json){
            name,
            open,
            close,
            (more metadata about company)
        },
        employees=>(json){
            employee=>{
                name,
                busytime,
                weekly_hours,
                workstation,
                (more metadata about employee)
            }
        }
      }
    }
    
  Caveat: 
    The workstation key in the employees json is very colab/LSC specific (might even just be a colab thing). 
    Consider making it a more abstract idea,
